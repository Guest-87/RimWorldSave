Sorry for the wait! Here's 1.0 for you guys.
十分抱歉让大家等了这么久，这是1.0版本适用的MOD。

A new recipe for mixing all your veggies into one compact pile. Produced at the butchering table by your chef.
新增了把所有的蔬菜混合成一堆的新食谱。由厨师在屠宰台上制作。

5 vegetarian products = 5 Veggie Mix
5个蔬菜 = 5个混合蔬菜

20 vegetarian products = 20 Veggie Mix
20个蔬菜 = 20个混合蔬菜

Can be used in any recipe that requires raw vegetables, including meals and kibble. Can be eaten raw (with a negative thought), or used to tame animals.
可用于任何需要蔬菜的食谱，包括膳食和拼盘。可以生吃（吃的人会很不高兴），也可以用来驯服动物。

Safe to add to existing saves!
可以安全附加到已有的存档中！

My first mod, so please let me know if there are any problems or errors! It *should* work with mods that add other plant producs, such as Vegetable Garden, but if there are incompatabilities, again, just leave a comment!

Code borrowed from 'Mince that Meat' by Whizzard, modified with help from Mehni. (Mince That Meat can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=889529242 )

Thank you to erdelf, SoggyNoodle, FuriouslyEloquent, and Mehni for helping me fix the code for the changes done to .19!
