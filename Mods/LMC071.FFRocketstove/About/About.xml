Adds an additional heat- and mealsource that doesn't use electricity and only little wood as fuel. The origin of this technology is unclear, as the superior draft-principle might have been invented or (re-)discovered by several people or cultures at different times and places in human history. Due to the elaborate proportions that are needed inside a rocketstove, more than only basic metal- and stoneworking knowledge is required to build it. Well, actually not at all, you might only need some crafty aptitude and common sense. But... balancing reasons!

火箭柴炉烹饪食物速度很快，并能通过石头传导燃烧产生的热量。用木头作燃料。和所有热源一样，它必须放在室内，这样它就可以加热一个封闭的空间。
